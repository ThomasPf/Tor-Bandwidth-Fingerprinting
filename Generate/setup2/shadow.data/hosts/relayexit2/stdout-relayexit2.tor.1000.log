Jan 01 00:04:20.000 [notice] Based on detected system memory, MaxMemInQueues is set to 8192 MB. You can override this by setting MaxMemInQueues by hand.
Jan 01 00:04:20.000 [warn] ControlPort is open, but no authentication method has been configured.  This means that any program on your computer can reconfigure your Tor.  That's bad!  You should upgrade your Tor controller as soon as possible.
Jan 01 00:04:20.000 [warn] Tor is running as an exit relay. If you did not want this behavior, please set the ExitRelay option to 0. If you do want to run an exit Relay, please set the ExitRelay option to 1 to disable this warning, and for forward compatibility.
Jan 01 00:04:20.000 [warn] You have used DirAuthority or AlternateDirAuthority to specify alternate directory authorities in your configuration. This is potentially dangerous: it can make you look different from all other Tor users, and hurt your anonymity. Even if you've specified the same authorities as Tor uses by default, the defaults could change in the future. Be sure you know what you're doing.
Jan 01 00:04:20.000 [warn] TestingTorNetwork is set. This will make your node almost unusable in the public Tor network, and is therefore only advised if you are building a testing Tor network!

Jan 01 00:04:20.000 [notice] It looks like I need to generate and sign a new medium-term signing key, because I don't have one. To do that, I need to load (or create) the permanent master identity key. If the master identity key was not moved or encrypted with a passphrase, this will be done automatically and no further action is required. Otherwise, provide the necessary data using 'tor --keygen' to do it manually.
Jan 01 00:04:20.000 [notice] Your Tor server's identity key fingerprint is 'relayexit2 48074E7A43F6BDB80D222593F21F56949F05F0AA'
